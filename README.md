## Abstract
The exponential growth of mobile devices, IoT, and other connected technologies has led to an unprecedented demand for spectrum resources, pushing existing 4G and 5G bands to their limits. Traditional static allocation methods are no longer sufficient. This impending spectrum scarcity threatens communication systems with congestion, interference, and compromised performance, despite many licensed bands remaining underutilized. 

Our project proposes an intelligent spectrum management system utilizing advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques. The core of this solution is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to enhance Spectrum Sensing (SS) capabilities, continuously monitoring and dynamically allocating available spectrum resources to mobile and IoT devices. This approach aims to maximize spectrum utilization and translate DL-based SS research into a practical, real-world implementation, encompassing both algorithmic contribution and practical system implementation.

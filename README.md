## Abstract
The rapid growth of mobile devices, IoT applications, and other connected technologies has placed immense pressure on spectrum resources, pushing 4G and 5G networks to their limits. Traditional static spectrum allocation methods can no longer meet this rising demand, resulting in increased congestion, interference, and degraded communication performance. Surprisingly, many licensed bands remain underutilized, highlighting the inefficiency of current approaches and the urgent need for smarter, more dynamic spectrum management.

Our project proposes an intelligent spectrum management system utilizing advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques. The core of this solution is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to enhance Spectrum Sensing (SS) capabilities, continuously monitoring and dynamically allocating available spectrum resources to mobile and IoT devices. This approach aims to maximize spectrum utilization and translate DL-based SS research into a practical, real-world implementation, encompassing both algorithmic contribution and practical system implementation.
